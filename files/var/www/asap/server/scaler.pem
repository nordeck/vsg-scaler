# This file should be a symbolic link to the public key file of
# jitsi-component-sidecar. This file is inside `/var/www/asap/server/` and it
# uses a HASH as name.
#
# There should be only one PEM file in this folder by default. If this is the
# case, you may create the symbolic link by running the following commands:
#
#   rm -f /var/www/asap/server/scaler.pem
#   ln -s /var/www/asap/server/*.pem /var/www/asap/server/scaler.pem
#   cat /var/www/asap/server/scaler.pem
